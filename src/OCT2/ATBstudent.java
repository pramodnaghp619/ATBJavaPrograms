//An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
// The example of an intangible object is the banking system.
// When we create an object which is a non primitive data type, it’s always allocated on the heap memory.
    //A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
    //Class does not occupy memory
    // It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
// An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only
//A class can only be declared once.  Objects can be created many times as per requirement.



    //Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.
    // The main aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
//Pillars of OOPs
//Abstraction
//Encapsulation
//Inheritance
//Polymorphism
//Compile-time polymorphism
//Runtime polymorphism
    //OOP promotes code reusability: By using objects and classes, you can create reusable components, leading to less duplication and more efficient development.
    //OOP enhances code organization: It provides a clear and logical structure, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
    //OOP supports the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle: This principle encourages minimizing code repetition, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. Common functionalities are placed in a single location and reused, reducing redundancy.
    //OOP enables faster development: By reusing existing code and creating modular components, OOP allows for quicker and more efficient application development
